Upgrade
=======

1. Backup your system/pancake/config/database.php config file.
2. Backup your uploads directory (just in-case).
3. Upload the index.php, and the system and third_party folders...overwriting the existing ones.
4. Place your backed up database config file back.
5. That's it! Enjoy your updated Pancake.
