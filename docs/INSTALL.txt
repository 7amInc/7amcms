Pancake
=======

Thank you for purchasing Pancake.

Installation
------------

1.  Upload the pancake directory somewhere publicly accessible on your web server.  You may rename it to anything you like.
2.  You may rename example.htaccess to .htaccess to remove the index.php from your URLs if your server supports mod_rewrite.
3.  Visit the url where you have uploaded Pancake too (i.e. http://example.com/billing).

You will be greeted by an installation wizard.  Simply follow the instructions on the screen.

When complete you MUST remove or rename the installer directory in order to login.

Have fun!
